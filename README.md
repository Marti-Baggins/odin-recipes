# odin-recipes

## Description
### Purpose
#### This project is the first of many for the WebDev program by The Odin Project. It will format a series of staple recipes I make and how to cook them!

## Reflections
### Beginning

#### I've finally gotten my SSH key issues figured out and ready to move forward as of 9/28/22! Recipes coming soon and hopefully I have enough to keep the site as a project going forward!
